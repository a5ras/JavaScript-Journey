# My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository contains all my notes, exercises, and projects as I learn JavaScript. My goal is to build a solid foundation in JS, which is critical for my work in web application security.

## About This Repository

* **Goal:** To master the fundamentals of JavaScript, from variables to asynchronous code.
* **Why:** A deep understanding of JavaScript is essential for finding and exploiting complex vulnerabilities like **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
* **Method:** I am studying for one hour every day as part of my daily program.
